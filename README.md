# GeogWCC
### Geographically Weighted Correlation Coefficient


In `GWCC-1.ipynb`, I did the standardization routine inside of the `iwls.py`., I also copy-pasted the code for the `_compute_betas_gwr()` function that I modified in the iwls.py

in `GWCC-2.ipynb`, I  tried out a single variable GWR, and the result of the slope/coefficient was the same as the correlation coefficient.
